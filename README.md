# Super-Mario-63

Source code as of 2010. This project has been converted from FlashPlayer Professional CS4 to FlashPlayer Professional CS6 Uncompressed XFL format.

Feel free to make changes and pull-requests. Hoever be warned: I'm not too sure how compatible the XFL format is with git (you might have a lot of line changes even if you only changed something small).

## Compatible Development Applications

Adobe Flash Professional CS6 - works
FlashDevelop - not tested

## Source images

The source images of the project have been converted into PNG format and placed locally next to where they exist in the FlashPlayer Professional library. However, these generated PNGs are not connected to the game's source. So if you update a PNG, then build and run, it won't work unless you fix the path in the editor first.
